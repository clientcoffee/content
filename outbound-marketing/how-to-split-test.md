# What is Split Testing? {#what-is-split-testing?}

Here's the bad news: Your first campaign is likely one of your worst. At least if you do things correctly.

You should be improving over time, so your first campaigns should be the worst. Split testing is the cheatcode to ensure you have a rock solid cold email campaign.

Split testing, or A/B testing, is like a combo move in marketing gymnastics. In essence, it's about comparing two (or more) versions of an email to see which one performs better. It's the secret sauce to tweaking and refining until you've got a cold email that makes prospects say, "Wow, take my money!"

## Types of Split Testing {#types-of-split-testing}

### A/B Testing {#a/b-testing}

* This is the classic peanut butter and jelly of testing. You create two versions (A and B) of a single variable to see which resonates better with your audience.
* Best for: Subject lines, email content, call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
Multivariate Testing

### Multivariate Testing {#multivariate-testing}

* Think of this as the buffet approach. You change multiple elements at once to see which combo reel in the best results. It's like a science experiment, but way cooler.
* Best for: Testing comprehensive changes like layout and design, different CTAs, and content variations in one go.
Statistical Significance

### Statistical Significance {#statistical-significance}

* This is the numbers game. It's all about ensuring your test results aren't just flukes.
* For cold email campaigns, we use a sample size of 500 when we first get started because a lot of ideas just won't be that good, and a couple will stand out as initial winners.
* After we have a working campaign, we raise that statistical significance number to 1000 per campaign
* You want enough data so that you can confidently say, "Yes, this is the one!"
* Meaningful insights come from a large enough sample size. Hubspot has a good article explaining [statistical significance in laymen's terms](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketers-guide-understanding-statistical-significance), and [how to choose a sample size](https://tools4dev.org/resources/how-to-choose-a-sample-size/).

# What to split test {#what-to-split-test}

You can test anything, but some of the low hanging fruit will lie in the:

* **Subject lines**: The first thing your
* **Opening line**: Like Alex Hormozi [says](https://www.acquisition.com/training/leads7) in his book, $100M Dollar Leads, 'big fast value'.
* **Offer**: I shouldn't have to tell you this, but you should be creating new offers every few weeks, and testing a few against each other. Times change, markets change; cold outbound marketing is the _cheapest_ form of lead generation in existence: try new stuff in this arena, and you can apply that to your paid campaigns to super-charge them

Crafting how you present your offer is an art. Are you dangling a carrot or offering a gold medal

Split testing helps refine the approach until prospects can't resist clicking that tempting, little button.

## Positioning the Offer {#positioning-the-offer}

Highlight different benefits to see what resonates. Test new offers (ie. limited discounts, complimentary services, time-sensitive offers, etc.).

Here's an idea of what that looked like for a law firm we worked with:

1. `We help {{specific law firm type}} to attract 80% more clients and reduce their cost of acquisition by 400% by implementing our Google Ads client acquisition system.`
2. `We help your law firm become the go-to {{specific law firm type}} practice in {{location}} with Google Ads that bring in clients without the heavy lifting.`
3. `We take the client acquisition burden off law firms desks by implementing our Google Ads acquisition system to attract and retain 80% more clients.`
4. `We enable law firms to attract 80% more clients and reduce their lead costs by 400% by implementing our Google Ads acquisition system.`
5. `We take the hassle of client acquisition off your plate with our Google Ads system, helping you bring in and keep up to 80% more clients.`
6. `We help your law firm become the go-to {{specific law firm type}} practice in {{location}} with smart Google Ads that attract and engage clients automatically.`
7. `We help make your law firm the top {{specific law firm type}} practice in {{location}} by using Google Ads that bring in clients effortlessly.`
8. `We help your law firm stand out as the best {{specific law firm type}} practice in {{location}} by setting up Google Ads that attract clients without the extra work.`

## Tonality and Language

* Casual vs. formal: Test out a more casual tone (ie. Add humour, add a meme Be quirky), versus a more formal tone (button up, use tighter, more formal language):

Here are some examples for a commercial pool cleaning contractor we worked with:

* **Informal:** _"We jump in and make sure your poolâ€™s always sparkling and ready for fun!"_
* **Casual:** _"Our team keeps your pool crystal-clear and free of any gunk, all year round."_
* **Semi-Formal:** _"We provide professional pool cleaning that ensures your water stays safe and inviting for guests."_
* **Formal:** _"Our services ensure that your commercial pool maintains its pristine condition, meeting the highest standards of safety and cleanliness."_
* **Playful:** _"We work our magic to banish algae and grime, leaving your pool a total showstopper!"_

Don't forget, you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time. Start with one or two elements and gradually tweak based on real-life results. Who said science can't be fun, right? ðŸš€
